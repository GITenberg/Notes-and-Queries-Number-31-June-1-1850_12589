<h3>OUR SECOND VOLUME.</h3>

<p>We cannot resist the opportunity which the commencement of our Second
Volume affords us, of addressing a few words of acknowledgment to our
friends, both contributors and readers. In the short space of seven months,
we have been enabled by their support to win for "NOTES AND QUERIES" no
unimportant position among the literary journals of this country. We came
forward for the purpose of affording the literary brotherhood of this great
nation an organ through which they might announce their difficulties and
requirements, through which such difficulties might find solution, and such
requirements be supplied. The little band of kind friends who first rallied
round us has been reinforced by a host of earnest men, who, at once
recognising the utility of our purpose, and seeing in our growing
prosperity how much love of letters existed among us, have joined us heart
and hand in the great object we proposed to ourselves in our Prospectus;
namely, that of making "NOTES AND QUERIES" by mutual intercommunication, "a
most useful supplement to works already in existence&mdash;a treasury for
enriching future editions of them&mdash;and an important contribution towards a
more perfect history than we yet possess of our language, our literature,
and those to whom we owe them."</p>

<p>Thanks, again and again, to the friends and correspondents, who, by their
labours, are enabling us to accomplish this great end. To them be the
honour of the work. We are content to say with the Arabian poet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
    <p>"With conscious pride we view the band</p>
    <p>Of faithful friends that round us stand;</p>
    <p>With pride exult, that we alone</p>
    <p>Can join these scattered gems in one;</p>
    <p>Rejoiced to be the silken line</p>
    <p>On which these pearls united shine."</p>

<h3 id="notes">NOTES.</h3>

<h4 id="notes1">PARISH REGISTERS.&mdash;STATISTICS.</h4>

<p>Among the good services rendered to the public by yourself and your
correspondents, few, I think will be found more important than that of
having drawn their attention to Mr. Wyatt Edgell's valuable suggestions on
the transcription of Parochial Registers. The supposed impracticability of
his plan has perhaps hitherto deterred those most competent to the work
from giving it the consideration which it deserves. I believe the
scheme to be perfectly practicable; and, as a first move in the work, I send
you the result of my own dealings with the registers of my parish.</p>

<p>It is many years since I felt the desideratum which Mr. Edgell has brought
before the public;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>{2}</span>
and, by way of testing the practicability of
transcribing, and printing the parochial registers of the entire kingdom in
a form convenient for reference, I made an alphabetical transcript of my
own, which is now complete. The <i>modus operandi</i> which I adopted was
this:&mdash;1. I first transcribed, on separate slips of paper, each baptismal
entry, with its date, and a reference to the page of the register, tying up
the slips in the order in which the names were entered in the register;
noting, as I proceeded, on <i>another</i> paper, the number of males and
females in each year.</p>

<p>2. The slips being thus arranged, they came in their places handy for
collation with the original.  I then collated each, year by year; during
the process depositing the slips one by one in piles alphabetically,
according to the initial letter of the surnames.</p>

<p>3. This done, I sorted each pile in an order as strictly alphabetical as
that used in dictionaries or ordinary indices.</p>

<p>4. I then transcribed them into a book, in their order, collating each page
as the work proceeded.</p>

<p>5. I then took the marriages in hand, adopting the same plan; entering each
of these twice, viz.  both under the husband's and the wife's name.</p>

<p>6. Next, the burials, on the same plan.</p>

<p>7. I then drew up statistical tables of the number of baptisms, marriages,
and burials in each year, males and females separately where the register
appeared badly kept, making notes of the fact, and adding such observations
as occasionally seemed necessary.</p>

<p>8. I then drew up lists of vicars, transcripts of miscellaneous records of
events, and other casual entries that appeared in the register.<a id="footnotetagA"
name="footnotetagA"></a><a href="#footnoteA"><sup>A</sup></a></p>

<p>I noted, as I went on, the time occupied in each of these operations. It
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>My registers begin in the year 1558, and the present population of the
parish is about 420, so that you have here an account of the labour
necessary to complete an alphabetical transcript of the register of a rural
parish of that extent in population.</p>

<p>I send you the result as a first step to a work of great national
importance, and of inestimable value with relation to family descent, title
to property long in abeyance, &amp;c. &amp;c. As to statistics, I doubt whether any
data worthy of consideration can be obtained from these sources, owing to
the constant irregularities which occur in keeping the registers.</p>

<p>No man, much less the minister of a parish, who has abundant calls upon his
time, can be expected to sit down to the task of transcribing his registers
through many <i>consecutive</i> hours; but there are few who could not give
occasionally one or two hours to the work. In this way I effected my
transcripts; the work of 195 hours being distributed through nearly five
months&mdash;no great labour after all.</p>

<p>On an average, twelve words, with the figures, may be calculated for each
entry, which will give for this parish about 500 folios. Each entry having
been transcribed twice, we may call it, at a rough calculation, 1000 folios
written out ready for printing.</p>

<p>If the authorities at the Registrar-General's office would give their
attention to it, they must have <i>there</i> abundant data on which to form
calculations as to the probable cost of the undertaking And I cannot help
thinking that, setting aside printing as an after consideration,
alphabetical transcripts, at least, might be obtained of all the parochial
registers in the kingdom, and deposited in that office, at no
insurmountable expense; and if the cost appear too heavy, the
accomplishment of the work might be distributed through a given number of
years; say ten, or even twenty.</p>

<p>Parliament might, perhaps, be induced to vote an annual grant for so
important a work till it was accomplished; albeit, when we think of their
niggardly denial of any thing to the printing, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>{3}</span> even the conservation
of the public records, sanguine hopes from that quarter can hardly be
indulged.</p>

<p>To insure correctness, without which the scheme would be utterly valueless,
I would propose that a certain number of competent transcribers be
appointed for each county, either at a given salary, or at a remuneration
of so much per entry, to copy the registers of those parishes the ministers
of which are unwilling to do it, or feel themselves unequal to the task.
The option, however, should always, in the first instance, be given to the
minister, as the natural custos of the registers, and as one, from local
knowledge, likely to do the work correctly. To each county there should
also be appointed one or more competent persons as collators, to correct
the errors of the transcribers.</p>

<p>I throw out these rough hints in the hope that some of your correspondents
will furnish their ideas on the subject, till we at last arrive at a fully
practicable plan of carrying out Mr. Wyatt Edgell's suggestions, and, at
all events, obtain transcripts, if not printed copies, of every register in
the kingdom.</p>

<p>To obviate the difficulties arising from capricious spelling,
I assumed that which I thought to be the correct one, and entered all of
the name under that one, placing, however, in parenthesis, the actual mode
of spelling adopted in the instance in question, and also entering the
name, as actually spelt, in its proper place, with reference to the place
where the searcher would find it; e.g. In my register, the name of "Caiser"
appears under more than twenty varieties of form. I enter them all under
"Cayser". In the <i>margin</i>, opposite the first of these entries, I
write consecutively the different modes of spelling the name&mdash;"Caisar",
"Caiser", "Casiar", "Kayser", &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. In the table itself, I write,</p>

<blockquote>
Cayser, John.<br />
[Casiar] John.<br />
[Kaysar] John, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Then, "Casiar", "Kaysar", &amp;c., appear in their respective places <i>sic</i>,
"Casiar", <i>v</i>. "Cayser", "Kaysar", <i>v</i>. "Cayser", &amp;c., nearly on the plan
adopted by Mr.  Duffus Hardy in his admirable indices to the <i>Close
Rolls</i>.</p>

<h4 id="notes2">THE HUDIBRASTIC VERSE.</h4>

<p><i>"He that fights and runs away," &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent MELANION may be
assured that the orations of Demosthenes do not afford any trace of the
proverbial senarius, &alpha;&nu;&eta;&rho; &delta;
&phi;&epsilon;&upsilon;&gamma;&omega;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&iota;
&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&iota;&nu; &mu;&alpha;&chi;&eta;&sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;; and it
does not appear quite clear how the apophthegm containing it (which has
been so generally attributed to Plutarch) has been concocted. Heeren, in
doing full justice to the biographical talent of the Chæronean, has yet
observed, "We may easily see that in his Lives he only occasionally
indicates his authorities, because his own head was so often the source."
It is in the life of Demosthenes that the story of his flight is told, but
briefly; and for that part which relates to the inscription on the shield
of Demosthenes, he says, '&omega;&sigmaf; &epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;
&Pi;&upsilon;&theta;&epsilon;&alpha;&sigmaf;.  The other life among
those of the Ten Orators, the best critics think not to be Plutarch's; and
the relation in it is too ridiculous for credit; yet it is repeated by
Photius.</p>

<p>The first writer in which the story takes something of the form in which
Erasmus gives it is Aulus Gellius (<i>Noct. Att.</i> l. xvii. c. 21.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Post inde aliquanto tempore Philippus apud Chaeroneam
    proelio magno Athenienses vicit. Tum Demosthenes orator ex eo
    proelio salutem fuga quaesivit: quumque id ei, quod fugerat,
    probrose objiceretur; <i>versu illo notissimo</i> elusit,
    &alpha;&nu;&eta;&rho; &delta; &phi;&epsilon;&upsilon;&gamma;&omega;&nu;,
    inquit, &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &pi;&alpha;&lambda;&iota;&nu;
    &mu;&alpha;&chi;&eta;&sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We here see that the senarius is designated as <i>a well-known verse</i>,
so that it must have been in the mouths of the people long before it was
applied to this piece of gossip. I have hitherto not been able to trace it
to an earlier writer.</p>

<p>The Apophthegmata of Erasmus were first published, I believe, in 1531, in
six books. I have an edition printed by Frobenius, at Basle, in 1538, in
which two more books are added; and, in an epistle prefixed to the seventh
book, Erasmus says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Prodiit opus, tanta aviditate distractum est, ut protinus à
    typographo coeperit efflagitare denuo."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He names twenty-one ancient Greek and Latin authors from which the
apophthegms had been collected; and, with regard to what he has taken from
Plutarch, he mentions the licence he has used:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Nos Plutarchum multis de causis sequi maluimus quam
    interpretari, explanare quam vertere."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is from this book of Erasmus that the worthy Nicolas Udall selected his
<i>Two Bookes of Apophthegmes</i>; and he tells his readers,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"I have been so bold with mine author as to make the first
    booke and second booke, which he maketh third and fowerth."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Udall has occasionally added further explanations of his own to those
translated from Erasmus.  He promises, in good time, the remaining, books,
but says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"I have thought better, with two of the eight, to minister
    unto you a taste of this bothe delectable and fruitefull
    recreation."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who are desirous of knowing at large the course pursued by Erasmus in
the compilation of this amusing and once popular work, will find it fully
stated in his preface; one passage of which will show the large licence he
allowed himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Sed totum opus quodammodo meum feci, dum et explanatius
    effero qua Graece referuntur, interjectis interdum quæ apud
    alios autores additur comperissem," &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only sure ground, as far as I can discover, for this gradually
constructed legend, is the mention of the flight of Demosthenes by
Æschines and Dinarchus. In the more amplified editions of Erasmus's
<i>Adages</i>, after the publication of the Apophthegmata, he repeats the story
in illustration of a Latin proverb (probably only a version of the Greek),
"Vir fugiens et denuo pugnabitur;" and I find in some collections of the
sixteenth century both the Latin and Greek given upon the authority of
Plutarch! Langius, in his <i>Polyanthea</i> (a copious common-place book which
would outweigh twenty of our late Laureate's) has given the apophthegm
verbatim from Erasmus, and has boldly appended Plutarch's name. But the
more extraordinary course is that which one Gualandi took, who published,
at Venice, in 1568,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>{4}</span>
in 4to., an <i>omnium gatherum</i>, in five books, from
various sources, in which there is much taken from Erasmus, and yet the
title is <i>Apoftemmi di Plutarco</i>. In this book, the whole of the
twenty-three apophthegms of Erasmus which relate to Demosthenes are given,
and two more added at the end. It appears that Philelphus, and after him
Raphael Regius, had printed, in the fifteenth century, Latin collections
under the title of <i>Plutarch's Apophthegms</i>, and, according to
Erasmus, had both taken liberties with their original. I have not seen
either of these Latin versions, of which there were several editions. As
far as regards Demosthenes, I think we may fairly conclude that the story
is apocryphal. The Greek proverbial verse was no doubt a popular saying,
which Aulus Gellius thought might give a lively turn to his story, of which
an Italian would say, "Se non vero è ben trovato."</p>

her life passed at Brougham Castle in 1675, afford a further illustration
of the custom of presenting gloves (Vol. i. pp. 72. 405.) as a matter of
courtesy and kindness; and show, also, that it was not unusual to make
presents of small sums of money in exhibition of the same feelings on the
part of the donor:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"January, as the year begins on New Year's Day.</p>

    <p>"10th day, And to-day there dined here with my folks my cousin
    Thomas Sandford's wife, of Askham, and her second son; so after
    dinner I had them into my chamber and kissed her, and took him by
    the hand, and I gave her a pair of buckskin gloves, and him 5<i>s</i>.,
    and then they went away.</p>

    <p>"12th day. There dined here in the Painted Chamber with my folks
    Mrs. Jane Carleton, the widow, sister to Sir W'm. Carleton,
    deceased. So after dinner I had her into my chamber, and kissed
    her and talked with her awhile, and I gave her 5<i>s</i>., and she went
    away.</p>

    <p>"17th day, To-day there dined with my folks my cousin, Mr. Thomas
    Burbeck, of Hornby, and his wife and their little daughter, and
    his father-in-law, Mr.  Cotterick, and his wife and his mother;
    and there also dined here Mr. Robert Carleton, only son to the
    widow, Lady Carleton. So after dinner I had them all into my
    chamber, and kissed the women, and took the men by the hand, and
    I gave to my cousin, Mr.  Burbeck, and his wife each 10<i>s</i>., and
    his mother 10<i>s</i>., and his father-in-law, Mr. Cotterick, and his
    wife, each of them 10<i>s</i>., and 6<i>s</i>. to the child, and I gave Mr.
    Carleton a pair of buckskin gloves, and then they all went away."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In another entry the Countess records the gift to a Mrs. Winch of Settra
Park of "four pair of buckskin gloves that came from Kendall."</p>

<p>It does not appear that any present was made to the Countess in return. As
in the case of Archbishop Laud and Master Prynne (Vol. i.  p. 405.), these
gifts were evidently expressions of condescension and good will by one in a
high position to another in a somewhat lower station.  It is, I take it,
evident that the money-gifts, from the rank in life of the parties, and
their connection with the Countess, could have been made with no other
meaning or intention.</p>

<p><a name="notes4a" id="notes4a"><i>Exhumation of a Body ominous to Family of the Deceased.</i></a>&mdash;In the counties
of Leicester and Northampton, and I doubt not in other parts of England,
there is a superstitious idea that the removal or exhumation of a body
after interment bodes death or some terrible calamity to the surviving
members of the deceased's family. Turner, in his <i>History of Remarkable
Providences</i>, Lond.  1677, p. 77., thus alludes to this superstition:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Thomas Fludd of Kent, Esq., told me that it is an old
    observation which was pressed earnestly to King James I., that he
    should not remove the Queen of Scots' body from Northamptonshire,
    where she was beheaded and interred. For that it always bodes ill
    to the family when bodies are removed from their graves.  For
    some of the family will die shortly after, as did Prince Henry,
    and, I think, Queen Anne."</p>

found in the latter part of the second volume of Forby's <i>Vocabulary of
East Anglia</i>.</p>

<p>1. To ascertain whether her pretended lovers really love her or not, the
maiden takes an apple-pip, and naming one of her followers, puts the pip in
the fire. If it makes a noise in bursting from the heat, it is a proof of
love; but if it is consumed without a crack, she is fully satisfied that
there is no real regard towards her in the person named.</p>

<p>2. "I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her." (<i>Shakesp.</i>)&mdash;The
efficacy of peascods in the concerns of sweethearts is not yet forgotten
among our rustic vulgar. The kitchen-maid, when she shells green peas,
never omits, when she finds one having <i>nine</i> peas, to lay it on the lintel
of the kitchen door; and the first clown who enters it is infallibly to be
her husband, or at least her sweetheart.</p>

<p>6. <a name="notes4c" id="notes4c"><i>Cure for Fits.</i></a>&mdash;If a young woman has fits, she applies to ten or a
dozen unmarried men (if the sufferer be a man, he applies to as many
maidens) and obtains from each of them a small piece of silver of any kind,
as a piece of a broken spoon, or ring, or brooch, buckle, and even
sometimes a small coin, and a penny; the twelve pieces of silver are taken
to a silversmith or other worker in metal, who forms therefrom a ring,
which is to be worn by the person afflicted. If any of the silver remains
after the ring is made, the workman has it as his perquisite; and the
twelve pennies also are intended as the wages for his work, and he must
charge no more.</p>

<p>In 1830 I went into a gunsmith's shop in the village where I then resided,
and seeing some fragments of silver in a saucer, I had the curiosity to
inquire about them, when I was informed that they were the remains of the
contributions for a ring for the above purpose which he had lately been
employed to make.</p>

<p><a name="notes4d" id="notes4d"><i>Bible and Key.</i></a>&mdash;Mr. Stevens's note on divination (Vol. i. p. 413.)
reminds me of another use to which the bible and key are made subservient
by the rustics in this locality. When some choice specimen of the
"Lancashire Witches" thinks it necessary to decide upon selecting a suitor
from among the number of her admirers, she not unfrequently calls in the
aid of these auxiliaries to assist in determining her choice. Having opened
the Bible at the passage in Ruth which states, "whither thou goest I will
go," &amp;c., and having carefully placed the wards of the key upon the verses,
she ties the book firmly with a piece of cord; and, having mentioned the
name of an admirer, she very solemnly repeats the passage in question, at
the same time holding the Bible suspended <i>by joining the ends of her
little fingers</i> inserted under the handle of the key. If the key retain its
position during the repetition, the person whose name has been mentioned is
considered to be rejected and so another name is tried until the book turns
round and falls through the fingers, which is said to be a sure token that
the name just mentioned is that of an individual who will certainly marry
her.</p>

<h4 id="notes7">ON AUTHORS AND BOOKS, NO. 7.</h4>

<p>The author of the volume of which I am about to give a character, from the
Ms. of sir William Musgrave, seems to be the person who is described by
Gough as "Arthur Dobbs, Esq. of Castle Dobbs, promoter of the discovery of
the N.W.  passage." The note may interest both historians and collectors of
books.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>AN ESSAY on the trade and improvement of
      Ireland. By Arthur Dobbs, Esq. <i>Dublin</i>,
      1729-31. 8vo.</p>

    <p>"This volume contains both the parts of the work and is a most
    curious collection of facts and accounts respecting the
    population revenue and trade of Ireland; and I believe it is
    scarce, as I have not often met with it, nor do I remember to
    have heard it quoted on either side during the warm disputes
    about the commercial intercourse between England and Ireland in
    the year 1785." [W. Musgrave.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I procured this volume from the collection of Mr. Heber, vii.  1682.&mdash;Sir
William Musgrave was a <i>Trustee</i> of the British Museum, and bequeathed near
two thousand volumes to that incomparable establishment. He was partial to
biography, and gave much assistance to Granger.  His <i>Adversaria</i> and
<i>Obituary</i>, I often consult.  The latter work is an excellent specimen of
well-applied assiduity. Ob. 1800.</p>

<h4 id="queries1">PUNISHMENT OF DEATH BY BURNING.</h4>

<p>Judging from the astonishment with which I learned from an eye-witness the
circumstance, I think that some of your readers will be surprised to learn
that, within the memory of witnesses still alive, a woman was burnt to
death under sentence of the judge of assize, for the murder of her husband.</p>

<p>This crime&mdash;petty treason&mdash;was formerly punished with fire and faggot; and
the repeal of the law is mentioned by Lord Campbell in a note to his life
of one of our recent chancellors, but I have not his work to refer to.</p>

<p>The post to which this woman was bound stood, till recently, in a field
adjoining Winchester.</p>

<p>She was condemned to be burnt at the stake; and a marine, her paramour and
an accomplice in the murder, was condemned to be hanged.</p>

<p>A gentleman lately deceased told me the circumstances minutely. I think
that he had been at the trial, but I know that he was at the execution, and
saw the wretched woman fixed to the stake, fire put to the faggots, and her
body burnt.  But I know two persons still alive who were present at her
execution, and I endeavoured, in 1848, to ascertain from one of them the
date of this event, and "<i>made a note</i>" of his answer, which was to this
effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"I can't recollect the year; but I remember the circumstance well.
    It was about sixty-five years ago.  I was there alone with the
    crowd. I sat on my father's shoulder, and saw them bring her and
    the marine to the field. They fixed her neck by a rope to the
    stake, and then set fire to the faggots, and burnt her."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She was probably strangled by this rope.</p>

<p>One Query which I would ask is, Was this execution at Winchester, in 1783
(or thereabouts), the last instance in England? and another is, Are you
aware of any other instance in the latter part of the last century?</p>

<h4 id="queries2">CORNELIS DREBBEL.</h4>

<p>In a very curious little book, entitled <i>Kronÿcke van Alemaer</i>, and
published in that town anno 1645, I read the following particulars about
Cornelis Drebbel, a native of the same city.</p>

<p>Being justly renowned as a natural philosopher, and having made great
progress in mechanics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>{7}</span> our Drebbel was named tutor of the young Prince
of Austria, by the emperor Ferdinandus II.; an office which he fulfilled so
well, that he was afterwards chosen councillor to his Majesty, and honoured
with a rich pension for past services. But, alas! in the year 1620, Prague,
the place he dwelt in, was taken by Frederick, then king of Bohemia,
several members of the imperial council were imprisoned, and some of them
even put to death.
</p>

<p>Bereft of every thing he possessed, a prisoner as well as the others, poor
Drebbel would perhaps have undergone the same lot if the High Mighty States
of the United Provinces had not sent a message to the King of England,
asking him to interfere in their countryman's favour. They succeeded in
their benevolent request for his English Majesty obtained at last from his
son-in-law, the Dutch philosopher's liberation, who (I don't exaggerate)
was <i>made a present of</i> to the British king; maybe as a sort of <i>lion</i>,
which the king of Morocco had never yet thought of bestowing upon the
monarch as a regal offering.</p>

<p>Drebbel, however, did not forget how much he owed to the intercession of
King James, and, to show his gratitude, presented him with an object of
very peculiar make. I will try to give you an exact version of its not very
clear description in the Dutch book.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"A glass or crystal globe, wherein he blew or made a perpetual
    motion by the power of the four elements.  For every thing which
    (by the force of the elements) passes, in a year, on the surface
    of the earth (sic!) could be seen to pass in this cylindrical
    wonder in the shorter lapse of twenty-four hours. Thus were
    marked by it, all years, months, days, hours; the course of the
    sun, moon, planets, and stars, &amp;c. It made you understand what
    cold is, what the cause of the <i>primum mobile</i>, what the first
    principle of the sun, how it moves the firmament, all stars, the
    moon, the sea, the surface of the earth, what occasions the ebb,
    flood, thunder, lightning, rain, wind, and how all things wax and
    multiply, &amp;c.,&mdash;as every one can be informed of by Drebbel's own
    works; we refer the curious to his book, entitled <i>Eeuwige
    Beweginghe</i> (Perpetual Motion)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can this instrument have been a kind of Orrery?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"He built a ship, in which one could row and navigate <i>under
    water</i>, from Westminster to Greenwich, the distance of two Dutch
    miles; even five or six miles, as far as one pleased. In this
    boat, a person could see under the surface of the water, and
    without candlelight, as much as he needed to read in the Bible or
    any other book. Not long ago, this remarkable ship was yet to be
    seen lying on the Thames or London river.</p>

    <p>"Aided by some instruments of his own manufacture, Drebbel could
    make it rain, lighten, and thunder at every time of the year, so
    that you would have sworn it came in a natural way from heaven.</p>

    <p>"By means of other instruments, he could, in the midst of summer,
    so much refrigerate the atmosphere of certain places, that you
    would have thought yourself in the very midst of winter. This
    experiment he did once on his Majesty's request, in the great
    Hall of Westminster; and although a hot summer day had been
    chosen by the King, it became so cold in the Hall, that James and
    his followers took to their heels in hasty flight.</p>

    <p>"With a certain instrument, he could draw an incredible quantity
    of water out of a well or river.</p>

    <p>"By his peculiar ingenuity, he could, at all times of the year,
    even in the midst of winter, hatch chickens and ducklings without
    using hens or ducks.</p>

    <p>"He made instruments, by means of which were seen pictures and
    portraits; for instance, he could show you kings, princes,
    nobles, although residing at that moment in foreign countries.
    And there was no paint nor painter's work to be seen, so that you
    saw a picture in appearance, but not in reality."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps a magic lantern?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"He could make a glass, that placed in the dark near him or
    another, drew the light of a candle, standing at the other end of
    a long room, with such force, that the glass near him reflected
    so much light as to enable him to see to read perfectly."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was this done by parallel parabolical mirrors?</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"He could make a plane glass without grinding it on either side,
    in which people saw themselves reflected seven times.</p>

    <p>"He invented all these and many other curiosities, too long to
    relate, without the aid of the black art; but by natural
    philosophy alone, if we may believe the <i>tongues</i> whose <i>eyes</i>
    saw it. By these experiments, he so gained the King's favour, his
    Majesty granted him a pension of 2000 guilders. He died in
    London, anno 1634, the sixtieth year of his age."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus writes the Alkmaar chronicler. If you, or any of your learned
correspondents, can elucidate the history of the instruments made by my
countryman, he will much oblige all scientific antiquarians, and me, though
not a Dr. Heavybottom, especially. I need not make apologies for my bad
English, and hope none of your many readers will criticise it in a <i>Dutch</i>
periodical.</p>

<h4 id="queries4">CULTIVATION OF GEOMETRY IN LANCASHIRE.</h4>

<p>It has been a frequent subject of remark, that geometry in its purest form
has been cultivated in the northern counties, but more especially in
Lancashire, with extraordinary ardour and success; and this by a class of
men placed in a position the most unpropitious that can be conceived for
the study&mdash;by operatives of the humblest class, and these chiefly
<i>weavers</i>. The geometrical labours of these men would have gladdened the
hearts of Euclid, Apollonius and Archimedes, and would have been chronicled
by Pappus with his usual truthfulness and judicious commendation; had they
only but so laboured in Greece, antecedently to, or cotemporarily with,
those "fathers of geometry," instead of in modern England, cotemporarily
with the Hargreaves, the Peels, and the Arkwrights. Yet not one in a
thousand of your readers, perhaps, has ever heard of these men; and the
<i>visible</i> traces of their existence and labours are very few, scarce, and
scattered. A vague general statement respecting the prevalence of
geometrical studies amongst the "middle-classes" of England was made by
Playfair in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> many years ago, which is quite
calculated to mislead the reader; and the subject was dwelt upon at some
length, and eloquently, by Harvey, at the British Association in 1831.
Attention has been more recently directed to this subject by two living
geometers&mdash;one in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, and the other in the
<i>Mechanics'</i>; but they both have wholly untouched a question of primary
importance&mdash;even almost unmentioned:&mdash;it is, <i>how</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, and by
<i>whom</i>, was this most unlikely direction given to the minds of these men?</p>

<p>An answer to this question would form an important chapter in the history
of human development, and throw much light upon the great educational
questions of the present day. It may furnish useful hints for legislation,
and would be of singular aid to those who were appointed to work out
legislative objects in a true spirit. It cannot be doubted that a succinct
account of the origin of this taste, and of the influences by which it has
been maintained even to the present hour, would be a subject of interest to
most of your readers, quite irrespective the greater or less importance and
difficulty of the studies themselves, as the result would show how
knowledge cannot only be effectively diffused but <i>successfully extended</i>
under circumstances apparently the most hopeless.</p>

<p>Nor does Manchester stand as the only instance, for the <i>weavers</i> of
Spitalfields display precisely the same singular phenomenon. What is still
more singular is, that the same class in both localities have shown the
same ardent devotion to natural history, and especially to Botany; although
it is to be remarked that, whilst the botanists of Spitalfields have been
horticulturists, those of Manchester have confined themselves more to
English field flowers, the far more worthy and intellectual of the two.</p>

<p>We could add a "Note" here and there on some points arising out of this
question; but our want of definite and complete information, and of the
means of gaining it (except through you), compels us to leave the subject
to others, better qualified for its discussion. Pray, sir, open your pages
to the question, and oblige, your ever obedient servants,</p>

<h4 id="queries5">ASINORUM SEPULTURA.</h4>

<p>In former times it was the practice, upon the demise of those who died
under sentence of excommunication, not merely to refuse interment to their
bodies in consecrated ground, but to decline giving them any species of
interment at all. The corpse was placed upon the surface of the earth, and
there surrounded and covered over with stones.  It was <i>blocked up</i>,
"imblocatus," and this mode of disposing of dead bodies was designated
"<i>Asinorum Sepultura.</i>" Ducange gives more than one instance, viz.,
"Sepultura asini sepeliantur"&mdash;"ejusque corpus exanime asinorum accipiat
sepulturam."</p>

<p>Wherefore was this mode of disposing of the dead bodies called "an ass's
sepulture?" It is not sufficient to say that the body of a human being was
buried like that of a beast, for then the term would be general and not
particular; neither can I imagine that Christian writers used the phrase
for the purpose of repudiating the accusation preferred against them by
Pagans, of worshipping an ass.  (See Baronius, ad. an. 201. §21.) The dead
carcasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>{9}</span> of dogs and hounds were sometimes attached to the bodies of
criminals. (See Grinds, <i>Deutsche Rechte Alterthum</i>, pp. 685, 686.) I refer
to this to show that there must have been some special reason for the term
"<i>asinorum sepultura</i>". That reason I would wish to have explained; Ducange
does not give it, he merely tells what was the practice; and the attention
of Grimm, it is plain, from his explanation of the "unehrliches begräbnis"
(pp. 726, 727, 728.), was not directed towards it.</p>

<h4 id="replies1">HOWKEY OR HORKEY.</h4>

<p><i>Howkey</i> or <i>Horkey</i> (Vol. i. p. 263.) is evidently, as your East Anglian
correspondent and J.M.B. have pointed out, a corrupt pronunciation of the
original <i>Hockey</i>; <i>Hock</i> being a heap of sheaves of corn, and hence the
<i>hock-cart</i>, or cart loaded with sheaves.</p>

<p>Herrick, who often affords pleasing illustrations of old rural customs and
superstitions, has a short poem, addressed to Lord Westmoreland, entitled
"The Hock-cart, or Harvest Home," in which he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <p>"The harvest swains and wenches bound,</p>
    <p>For joy to see the hock-cart crown'd."</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Die Hocke</i> was, in the language of Lower Saxony, <i>a heap of sheaves</i>.
<i>Hocken</i> was the act of piling up these sheaves; and in that valuable
repertory of old and provincial German words, the <i>Wörterbuch</i> of J.L.
Frisch, it is shown to belong to the family of words which signify a <i>heap</i>
or <i>hilly protuberance</i>.</p>

<p id="transnote3">We should have been prepared to find the word in East Anglia; but from
Herrick's use of it, and others, it must have formerly been prevalent in
the West of England also. It has nothing to do with <i>Hock-tide</i>, which is
the <i>Hoch-zeit</i> of the Germans, and is merely [Transcriber's note: illegible]
<i>feast</i> or <i>highday</i> of which a very satisfactory account will be found in
Mr.  Hampson's "Glossary" annexed to his <i>Medii Aevi Kalendarium</i>. An
interesting account of the <i>Hoch-zeit</i> of the Germans of Lower Saxony
occurs where we should little expect it, in the <i>Sprichwörter</i> of Master
Egenolf, printed at Francfort in 1548, 4to.; and may perhaps serve to
illustrate some of our obsolete rural customs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"We Germans keep carnival (all the time between Epiphany and
    Ash-Wednesday) St. Bernard's and St.  Martin's days, Whitsuntide
    and Easter, as times, above all other periods of the year, when
    we should eat, drink, and be merry. St. Burchard's day, on account
    of the fermentation of the new must. St. Martin's, probably on
    account of the fermentation of the new wine: then we roast fat
    geese, and all the world enjoy themselves.  At Easter we bake
    pancakes (<i>fladen</i>); at Whitsuntide we make bowers of green
    boughs, and keep the feast of the tabernacle in Saxony and
    Thuringia; and we drink, Whitsun-beer for eight days. In Saxony,
    we also keep the feast of St. Panthalion with drinking and eating
    sausages and roast legs of mutton stuffed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>{11}</span> garlic. To the
    <i>kirmse</i>, or church feast, which happens only once a year, four
    or five neighbouring villages go together, and it is a
    praiseworthy custom, as it maintains a neighbourly and kindly
    feeling among the people."</p>

<p>The pleasing account of the English harvest feast in Gage's <i>Hengrave</i>,
calls it <i>Hochay</i>. Pegge, in his Supplement to Grose's <i>Provincial Words,

of its observance in Suffolk given in the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> for
November, 1820. See also Major Moor's <i>Suffolk Words</i>, and Forby's
<i>Vocabulary of East Anglia</i>, who says that Bloomfield, the rustic poet of
Suffolk, calls it the <i>Horky</i>; Dr. Nares having said that Bloomfield does

<p><i>Charles Martel</i> (Vol. i. p. 86.)&mdash;The following note may perhaps be
acceptable in conjunction with that of G.J.K. (p. 86.), on Charles Martel.
It is taken from Michelet's <i>History of France</i>, an easily accessible work.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Charlemagne is usually considered as the translation of Carolus
    Magnus. 'Challemaines si vaut autant comme grant challes.'
    (<i>Chro. de St. Denis</i>, 1. i. c. 4.) Charlemagne is merely a
    corruption of Carloman, Karlmann, the strong man. In the
    above-cited chronicle itself, the words Challes and Challemaines
    are used for Charles and Carloman (<i>maine</i>, a corruption of
    <i>mann</i>, as <i>leine</i> of <i>lana</i>). In the <i>Chronicle of Theophanes</i> a
    still more conclusive text is found: he calls Carloman
    &Kappa;&alpha;&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&gamma;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;; <i>Scr. fr.</i> v. 187. The two brothers must have
    borne the same name. In the 10th century, Charles the Bald was
    dignified, though most undeservedly, with the same title of
    Great, through the ignorance of the Latin monks.&mdash;<i>Epitaph. ap
    Scrip. fr</i>. vii. 322.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
          <p class="i2">... Nomen qui nomine duxit</p>

    <p>A similar kind of blunder was made by the Greek
    writers in the name Elagabal, which they transformed
    into Heliogabal, from "'&Eta;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;, the sun."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With regard to Charles Martel, Michelet does not allude to M. Collin de
Plaucy's explanation, and adopts the old version&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Son surnom païen de Marteau me ferait volontiers douter s'il
    était chrétien. On sait que le marteau est l'attribut de Thor, le
    signe de l'association païcune, celui de la propriété de la
    conquête barbare."&mdash;Vide Michelet's <i>Origines du Droit Français</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Charles was notoriously at variance with the Church. I should consider
Michelet a much better authority than M. Collin de Plaucy, who, to judge
from his preface to another work, <i>Le Dictionnaire Infernal</i>, slavishly
submits his critical acuteness to the dicta of his Church.</p>

I should say no; and let me cite the familiar lines from the beginning of
Ovid's <i>Fasti</i>:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>{12}</span></p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>"Ne tamen ignores variorum jura dierum</p>

<p>The <i>dies festus</i> was not only not <i>dies fastus</i>, but <i>dies nefastus</i>.</p>

<p>Without going beyond <i>feast</i> and <i>fast</i>, I see nothing in C.B.'s suggestion
better than the old derivations of the words <i>feast</i> from <i>festus -um</i>, and
<i>fast</i> from the Anglo-Saxon; nor indeed anything half so good. <i>Feast</i> and
<i>fast</i> are opposed in meaning: our word <i>fast</i> has a meaning which neither
<i>fas, fari</i>, nor <i>fastus</i>, nor all three together, will explain.</p>

of the cherubim, originally designed to shadow forth the incarnate Deity,
to the four evangelists, with whom these emblematic representations are
still, as anciently, associated in architectural decorations and heraldic
bearings, appear to have originated, among the early Christians, in the
reverence with which they regarded the four gospels. JARLZBERG (Vol. i., p.
385.) explains why the lion is assigned to St.  Mark, and desires to know
the reasons assigned for the three other Evangelists' emblems.</p>

<p><a name="replies4j" id="replies4j"><i>The Arms of Godin</i></a>.&mdash;My attention has been drawn to a Query from Mr.
KERSLEY, in page 439.  of Vol. i., relative to the arms of Godin. I have
seen these arms blazoned variously. Mr. Godin Shiffner bears them quarterly
with his own coat of Shiffner, and blazons them thus:&mdash;<i>Party per fess,
azure and gules, a barr or; in chief, a dexter and sinister hand grasping a
cup, all proper</i>.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think this is an innovation upon the original arms, as I
have them painted on an old piece of china <i>azure, a cup or</i>. They are here
impaled with the arms of Du Fon, an ancient French family that intermarried
with the Godins.</p>

<p>In the <i>Théâtre de la Noblesse de Brabant</i>, I find that "François Godin,
Secrétaire ordinaire du Roy Philippe II., en grand conseil séant à
Malines," was ennobled by letters patent, dated Madrid, 7th January, 1589,
and "port les armoiries suivantes, qui sont, <i>un escu de sinople à une
coupe lasalade, ou couverture ouverte d'or; ledit escu sommé d'un heaume
d'argent grillé et liséré d'or; aux bourlet et hachements d'or et de
sinople: cimier une coupe de l'escu</i>."</p>

<p>This blazoning is corrected in the index, where the arms are stated to be
"<i>un escu de sinople à la coupe couverte d'or</i>."</p>

<p>In the <i>Nobiliaire des Pays-Bas</i>, I find that Daniel Godin, Seigneur de
Beauvois, was enobled by Philip IV. in 1623, and "les armes sont, <i>de
sinople à une coupe couverte d'or</i>."</p>

<p>In 1642, "Jean-François Godin, Seigneur de Baumez, Baillé et haut Justicier
de Reumes" (son of François Godin, who was ennobled by Philip II.),
obtained permission from Philip IV. to alter his paternal coat, and to
carry "<i>un écu de sinople à trois coupes couvertes d'or; cet écu timbré
d'un casque d'argent, grillé, liséré, et couronné d'or, orné de ses
lambrequins d'or et de sinople, et au-dessus en cimier, une tête et col de
licorne au naturel</i>."</p>

<p>His son, Jaques-François Godin, appears afterwards to have obtained the
title of Baron.</p>

<p>The earliest mention I can find of the Godin arms is in 1588, when
Christopher Godin carried "<i>de sinople à une coupe couverte d'or</i>." He was
a son of Jacques Seigneur d'Aubrecicourt and of Françoise Lettin, and
brother to the first-named François Godin. There appears to have been
another brother, Jaques; and they were all three ennobled by Philip II.,
probably for their public services, as Christopher was Conseiller et
Receveur-général des Domaines et Finances des Pays-Bas; Jacques, Conseiller
et Maître de la Chambre des Comptes en Hollande; and François, Secrétaire
du Grand Conseil à Malines.</p>

<p>I am not aware what connection existed between these Godins and the family
of that name in Normandy (now extinct); but the <i>cup</i> in the arms, though
borne differently, proves that they were of the same race.</p>

<p><a name="replies4l" id="replies4l"><i>Emancipation of the Jews</i></a> (Vol. i. p. 479.).&mdash;The following extract from
Tovey's <i>Anglia Judaica</i>, p. 259., may be acceptable in connection with
this subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"As soon as King Charles was murther'd, the Jews petitioned the
    Council of War to endeavour a repeal of that act of parliament
    which had been made against them; promising, in return, to make
    them a present of five hundred thousand pounds: Provided that
    they could likewise procure the cathedral of St. Paul to be
    procured them for a synagogue, and the Bodleian Library at Oxford
    to begin their traffic with, which piece of service it seems was
    undertaken by those <i>honest men</i>, at the solicitation of Hugh
    Peters and Henry Masters, whom the Jews employed as their brokers
    but without any success."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Afterwards, however, the Jews of Holland sent a deputation, consisting of
the famous Rabbi Manasseh ben Israel, and several wealthy Jewish merchants.
When Cromwell came into full power their hopes were raised, for he was
known to be favourable to their re-admission; but after much discussion,
the popular feeling, and the voices of many influential preachers, were
found to be so much against the measure that nothing was eventually done;
and Charles II. must be regarded as the restorer of the Jews to this
country. Tovey says that the Rabbi Netto, "the governor of the synagogue"
in his time, had searched the Jewish registers at his request, and had
found that, so late as 1663, there were but twelve Jews in England.  It
seems that while these negotiations were in hand, all sorts of absurd and
idle rumours were afloat. Among these I incline to reckon the alleged
proposal to purchase St. Paul's for a synagogue.  It seems to be
sufficiently refuted by the intrinsic absurdity of the thing. But beyond
this we have the express denial, made on the spot and at the time, by Rabbi
Manasseh ben Israel himself. On turning to his <i>Vindiciæ Judæorum</i>,
written in this country, I find that after recapitulating various calumnies
on his people&mdash;such as their sacrificing Christian children, etc.&mdash;he thus
goes on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"'Love and hatred,' says Plutarch, 'corrupt the truth of every
    thing;' as experience sufficiently declares it, when we see that
    which comes to pass, that one and the same thing, in one and the
    same city, at one and the same time, is related in different
    manners. I myself, in my own negociation here, have found it so.
    For it hath been rumoured abroad, that our nation had purchased
    St. Paul's church, for to make it their synagogue,
    notwithstanding it was a temple formerly consecrated to Diana.
    And many other things have been reported of us that never entered
    the thought of our nation."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="author">J.K.</p>

<p><a name="replies4m" id="replies4m"><i>Sneck-up or Snick-up.</i></a>&mdash;Surely this means nothing more or less than what
we should write <i>Hiccup!</i> or <i>Hiccough!</i> so, at least, I have always
supposed; misled, perhaps, by Sir Toby's surname, and his parenthetical
imprecation on "pickle herring". I do not pretend to be a critic of
Shakspeare, and must confess that I do not possess a copy of the "Twelfth
Night" but after seeing your correspondent R.R.'s letter (Vol. i., p.
467.), I resolved to write you a note. First, however, I called on a
neighbour to get a look at the text, and he brought me down Theobald's
edition of 1773, where it stands,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"<i>Sir To.</i> We did keep time, Sir, in our catches.<br />
    Sneck up!"                           [<i>Hiccoughs.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The effort necessary to pronounce the word "catches" might help to produce
a catch of another sort in the stomach of a gentleman oppressed with drink
and pickle herring; and it seems likely that some such idea was in the
author's mind.</p>

account of all such books, and of all copies of each class that are extant.
Mr.  Dickenson's object is, eventually to produce a complete <i>Catalogue

as to the MSS., a careful abstract of the contents of each, with a notice
of its probable age and of anything that may help to fix the place where it
was written, or intended to be used; and as to the printed copies,
supplying the title, colophon, foliation, and any peculiarities of type,
woodcuts, or ornaments, and including besides, an account of the origin and
history of the Anglican uses. Any information on these heads with which
that gentleman may be favoured, our readers may calculate on seeing turned

found it answer extremely well the purpose for which it was intended.

offer a few words of explanation to his correspondents in general, and
particularly to those who do not enable him to communicate with them except
in print. They will see, on a very little reflection, that it is plainly
his interest to take all he can get, and make the most, and the best of
everything; and therefore he begs them to take for granted that their

succeeding Numbers bear no proof of it. He is convinced that the want of
specific acknowledgment will only be felt by those who have no idea of the
labour and difficulty attendant on the hurried management of such a work,
and of the impossibility of sometimes giving an explanation, when there
really is one which would quite satisfy the writer, for the delay or
non-insertion of his communication. Correspondents in such cases have no
reason, and if they understood an editor's position they would feel that

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
